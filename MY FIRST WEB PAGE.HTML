<h2>Research intrest</h2>
    <p>We are a group of young, dedicated researchers determined to excel in our research in "Materials Chemistry". Our laboratory at present is located at Room No. A-108 and C-401A in the Department of Chemistry. Our research is mainly focused on functional materials and their applications in various fields. We are a multi-disciplinary research group with group members having background ranging from chemistry, biotechnology, paper technology to polymer science and technology. Our group is now focusing on research projects:</p>

<p>(1) Nanoporous high surface area materials for energy and environmental applications: We are focussing on synthesis of new materials using various organic and inorganic precursors and creating nanopores or channels in non-templating approaches. The synthesis of organic polymeric framework materials as well as inorganic-organic hybrid nanoporous materials are our target. Our focussed application areas are gas sroption and storage (such as carbon dioxide capture, hydrogen and methane storage etc.), Utilization of carbon dioxide to make molecules and materials of industrial importance, organocatalysis, supercapacitor applications, electrochemical sensing, adsorptive removal of pollutants, and any application envisoned for porous high surface area materials.</p>

<p>(2)Another research area of our interest is the immobilization of organic moieties and inorganic nanostructures on the surface of cellulose fibers of paper matrices and making them useful for high-end applciations such as chemibioactive paper, paper based catalysts etc.</p>
